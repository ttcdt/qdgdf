QDGDF TODO / Bug List
=====================

Release Critical Bugs
---------------------

None!

Open Bugs
---------

 * 1002: The DirectSound big sounds are not implemented.
 * 1005: The WAV file loader should do resampling on-the-fly.
 * 1009: Add scale 3 support to the ddraw driver.
 * 1011: Add some way of knowing which architecture (or which driver)
   is being used.
 * 1013: All unix sound should use the internal sound daemon (even
   daemon-based network sound systems like esd). It's the only way
   to correctly implement IRIX, arts and such.
 * 1014: Big sounds under unix loop bad (can be triggered by
   using the default value of _qdgdfa_big_sound_threshold in
   Space Plumber's menu music).
 * 1015: The scale2x (and 3x) modes leave the last horizontal
   line undrawn.
 * 1025: The OSS driver should take into account that the frequency
   could not be set (for hardware with fixed frequency).

Pending Enhancements
--------------------

 * 1000: Add an skeleton program and a skeleton Makefile.
 * 1001: Add a linux framebuffer driver.
 * 1003: Add mouse support.
 * 1004: Add joystick support.
 * 1028: Try using windowed mode in DirectX to fix/dodge #1026.

Closed
------

 * 1017: New function qdgdfa_set_attenuation(), to set the
   attenuation of a sound (Sun, 28 Nov 2004 19:41:31 +0100).
 * 1007: Create a new variable _qdgdfv_scale, to substitute
   _qdgdfv_double_mode (Mon, 29 Nov 2004 16:02:27 +0100).
 * 1008: Create a new triple mode, triggered by _qdgdfv_scale
   (needs #1007 closed). (Mon, 29 Nov 2004 16:41:19 +0100).
 * 1016: Add support for pgup, pgdn, home and end keys
   (Mon, 20 Dec 2004 22:28:34 +0100).
 * 1017: Add win32 detection to config.sh (Tue, 21 Dec 2004 10:37:29 +0100).
 * 1012: Update build system (Tue, 21 Dec 2004 12:14:55 +0100).
 * 1019: config.sh should fail if no video driver is found.
   (Thu, 23 Dec 2004 08:12:26 +0100).
 * 1010: Add a PATH-style string to qdgdfv_fopen(), where some
   colon-separated paths are sequentially tried prepended to
   the file to be open before banging (Sat, 08 Jan 2005 21:59:14 +0100).
 * 1020: Sometimes the oss sound server receives a command split
   in two, probably because of some pipe buffering issue; incomplete
   commands should be enqueued to be processed later
   (Sun, 09 Jan 2005 11:26:07 +0100).
 * 1021: The X11 driver in 8 bpp is broken
   (Thu, 13 Jan 2005 19:30:58 +0100).
 * 1022: qdgdfa_set_attenuation() doesn't work in the dsound driver
   (Closed by 1023; Sun, 23 Jan 2005 23:10:17 +0100).
 * 1023: The playing status of a sound in the dsound buffer is
   incorrectly detected. (Sun, 23 Jan 2005 23:11:10 +0100).
 * 1024: Alphanumeric keys don't work in the ddraw driver
   (Sun, 23 Jan 2005 23:59:44 +0100).
 * 1018: Build system description in README is severely outdated
   (Sun, 08 May 2005 10:57:30 +0200).
 * 1006: There should exist another PCX file loader that adapts
   each file's palette to the currently used one (instead of
   ignoring it like the current one) (Sat, 26 Nov 2005 18:51:30 +0100).
 * 1026: 320x200 and 640x400 video modes are broken under Win32, at
   least on NVidia cards (No longer relevant;
   Tue, 12 Jul 2011 16:44:38 +0200).
 * 1027: Add an OpenGL driver (added in 0.9.3;
   Wed, 20 Aug 2014 07:38:46 +0000).
